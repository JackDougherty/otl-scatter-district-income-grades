Quick notes on creating your own version:

1) Go to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtmGKybdRLlZdHBvSGxIdEJoc1YxNUxtTThGbU9Qcnc&usp=sharing">Google Sheet sample data template</a> and File > Make Copy to save in your own Google Drive, modify as instructed, and publish to the web.

2) Download a copy of the index.HTML template file, edit as instructed in the code comments, and host on the live web.

Two options to edit and host file on the live web:
- If you have a free GitHub account, you can "fork" (aka copy) my repository to your account, delete my "gh-pages" branch,  create your own "gh-pages" branch, and edit the index.html file to host on the web.
- Or learn how to freely <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B716ywBKT84AMXBENXlnYmJISlE/GoogleDriveHosting.html">host webpages on Google Drive</a>. Click this GitHub repository "download" button to obtain a zip file of the index.html page and upload to your Google Drive public host folder (or copy and paste its contents into your own index.html file). Edit as instructed in the code comments and make public on the live web.
